1 Removed the pads around the mounting holes in ethernet jack footprint.
2 Extended the ground zone on bottom layer to match the ground zone on top layer.
3 Added net pad clearance 0.254mm around mounting holes.
4 Made a mistake on picking program header 2 x 10, changed from SMT to Through hole part in BoM.
5 Made a mistake on picking debug header 1 x 6, changed from SMT to Through hole part in BoM.
6 Changed the 3.3V zone to match the border of other ground zones. Now all the power and ground zones are created based on grid size 1.27mm.
7 Vbus for USBLC6-4SC6 should be connected to 3.3v.
8 24mhz clock for synthesizer needs a 1k pull up resistor at the output. For next round, changed it to another clock that has a better output.
9 Removed the ferrite bead that connects digital and analog 3.3v close to MCU. FB101 and R308.
10 Added filter to PoE module. L101, C131.
11 A 10k ohm pull down resistor is required at pin2 of LAN8742.
12 Added PoE protection diode. U109, U110.
13 Added Bridge rectifiers to PoE module. U107, U108.
14 Pin 2, 4, 5 on the PoE module should NOT connect to the ground on the board.
15 Cleaned overlapping reference values.
16 From testing found that when SEL_SYNTH_1 goes high Synthesizer_0 is chosen. Thus change the pin name to SEL_SYNTH_0.
17 Change all the long power traces to 1mm width.
