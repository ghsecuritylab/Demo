This file contains the project based mapping to the symbol library.

It was getting an inappropriate E: drive letter added. We tried to work around
that using something like...
(sym_lib_table
  (lib (name 0EllBayInd-McFly)(type Legacy)(uri file:/Dev/ellbayind-mcfly/EllBayInd-McFly.lib)(options "")(descr ""))
)

But couldn't find a working version. There may be a way to do it with URI that
is properly formatted.

For now, you have to use Properties -> Manage Libraries -> Project Specific
and create an entry with nickname 0EllBayInd-McFly, and pointing to the
EllBayInd-McFly.lib master symbol library for this project.
